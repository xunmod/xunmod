So my family thought that playing on the computer = giving up my learning. Then they stop me from using the computer, even if they play games on it.  
Currently, I have to develop things on my server with 2GiB memory and 25GiB disk. And you know, it's impossible to compile AOSP on such computers.  
I'll archive most of `android_*` things since I couldnâ€™t develop them.
